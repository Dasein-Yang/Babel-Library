# 2020 04 13 Break Sisyphus 

[Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://book.douban.com/subject/1365035/)

Thanks to Uncle Phet's recommendation to read this book. Before that, I had always thought that it was a groundhog success story, but now I found that even in the most mundane language, it opens up a view of wealth that is worthy of my serious consideration now. 

Based on the premise of an immutable fact that the real world, driven by wealth and capital, is a given fact under the current society, the individual has no power to change and choose the times, no matter how many terms are used to describe the gap of wealth, the divisions of society or the postmodernity of the developed industrial age. 

For example, these days I see some recent twitter about the intergenerational conflict between young Americans and "boomers". Because same choices made by whom born in the late Great Depression or the economic fulled with bubble brought about totally different results. The plight and greatness of the times overriding one's entire life.

Similarly, the author's own father taught him the same view of wealth that most people are taught as childliren: to study hard and find a decent job to earn a living, to save money, to get married and have children, to follow a fixed trajectory. It is inevitable to complain, criticize, and flee when you reach middle crisis, perhaps try to give some meaning to your life by exaltation of work. However, sometimes, we have contempt for money while be driven by consumerism and money when pay for the bills in daily life as part of the rat race. To change the age of capitalism by condemning the rich, the capitalists, the world, is unrealistic but most fantastically easy way.

If I follow this path, I am bound to become a mundane depressed person.  Choosing and executing smart strategies in the tone of the times and in the role of the individual is far more actionable than being depressed for life. Manage wealth is the key to escape from Sisyphus.

Before making a better strategies, I have to avoid two weakness. First, it is hard to self-discipline, which can be seen as I have not enough vision for the long term return but choose short term returns. The difficulty of self-discipline itself is that no one can fully see what their future will be, but they can easily see what the present is. Only after a lifetime of meandering through and then connecting the dots in our life will we know which roads are the detours. It remind me of Jonas Hsu's words in an interview not long ago, "Have a vision to see what you have not seen".

For a young person, such as me, I'm afraid this statement by Mr. Xu is difficult to make, as people are easily enslaved by desires, fears and emotions, and have only limited information from his layer or circle, easily to be incited by the group effect. It is extremely common to be brainwashed by consumerism and get into financial crisis, impressed by cheap loves and words to make failed decisions, and cowardly to miss out on great opportunities driven by fear. There is no such fatal weakness in the machine that would reduce fault tolerance and change the trajectory of the algorithm, and trying to control humanity towards the machine is a too tool-rational idea.

Secondly, I don't have strong desires. In fact, except when it is best to try to control greed and fear trading stock,  you can face your desires such as the desire for luxury drive us to make money, fear of the "unwanted life" drive us to self-manage, emotions of nature brings about goodness.By this way,we can harness own humanity rather than being harnessed by humanity. This is where most of my syndrome lies, where the most important spiritual forces in my life are often thrown into the wilderness by me in an attempt to get there through self-control, with the end result being pettiness, fear of failure, avoidance of life and relationships, lack of self-discipline and overconfidence. Last month, I lost the desire for all things, food, true love , life, beauty, books, money, but life didn't get any better, nor did I gain any spiritual strength. The rest of my life, I wish I had lived a less vain life, to get closer to humanity, to find the tiniest and the most realistic meaning and desire and then achive it. 

The next step was to establish the idea of wealth in line with the rules of the game, which should have been the key out of the book's generalization. A few more meaningful caveats are followed.

\1. It is important to spend a lifetime on continuous, broad and rapid learning. Not to learn what one specializes in, but to constantly revise one's perception and understanding of the world through a variety of information, just as a stochastic process with Bayesian optimization, where enough prior knowledge are adopted to improve the accuracy of the next decision.

\2. Finance perspective: accounting, investment, markets, law, the more you know, the better you can manage your firm and career. For example, managing your own cash flow, ego and time, reading financial reports, developing a sense of the financial markets for wealth and personal finance, identifying assets or liabilities, using economic perspectives and models for self development, caring about opportunity costs and rates of return on investment.

\3. Pay yourself first. The most important thing is always yourself, and the buried 996 is exhausting, squeezing out all residual value and depriving opportunities for learning and upgrading. Don't carry a bigger bill just to pay it.

\4. Information is the most expensive thing, and in order to be accurate and effective, one has to willingly pay a high value to hire or turn to the most professional person.

\5. Finally, at a young age, it is possible to take quick trial.I should have a systemic view of risk and more robust, continuously optimize and iterate myself.

\6. Any way, may you live on this precious earth, escape from the fate of Sisyphus, and be a good person for all.
